# SmartParticipation

SmartParticipation is an open source e-participation platform based on Drupal and designed to offer an effective and adaptable environment for informed online discussion.  Developed by [CeRI](http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/ceri/), a cross-disciplinary group of Cornell University researchers. 

For more information, contact us at

## Installation

This is a Drupal 7 installation profile with core modules for quickly building a SmartParticipation site.  Your web server must meet the [Drupal 7 system requirements](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/system-requirements/overview) and [Drush](http://docs.drush.org/en/master/) must be installed.

To build the profile and automatically assemble Drupal core with all required dependencies, run:
 
`drush make build-smartparticipation.make /path/to/webroot`
