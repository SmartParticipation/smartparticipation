# SmartParticipation

SmartParticipation is a platform designed to provide an effective and adaptable environment for online discussion. 
Developed and refined by Cornell University researchers during years of hosting live public comment on proposed new 
federal regulations, SmartParticipation can help your organization sponsor online discussion that is thoughtful, diverse 
and meaningful. For more information, contact us at

## Installation

This is a Drupal 7 installation profile with core modules for quickly building a SmartParticipation site.  Your web server must meet the [Drupal 7 system requirements](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/system-requirements/overview) and [Drush](http://docs.drush.org/en/master/) must be installed.

To build the profile and automatically assemble Drupal core with all required dependencies, run:
 
`drush make build-smartparticipation.make /path/to/webroot`
